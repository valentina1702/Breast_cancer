**Breast Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks**


---

Breast Cancer the most common among women worldwide accounting for 25 percent of all cancer cases and affected millions of people, early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survival.  

*   The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign.
*   Mammography is clinically used as the standard breast cancer screening exam for the general population and has been shown effective to a bit in early detection of breast cancer and in reduction of mortality.

*   One approach to improving mammographic interpretation is to provide the radiologist with powerful computerized tools to aid in image interpretation and decision-making. 
*   To help radiologist make more accurate decisions on predicting the cancer type, we focused on building classifiers that can distinguish subtle imaging characteristics of mammograms from patients, and can assist radiologists in predicting which patients/images may be benign and which maybe be malignant.

**Datasets:** 


1.   MIAS: Images from Fatty tissue, fatty-glandular tissue and dense glandular tissue with benign and malignant labels
2.   DDSM: Images with masses of benign severity, masses of malignant
severity, calcifications of benign severity and calcifications of malignant severity. 

**Models used:**



1.   VGG-16
2.   ResNet-50
